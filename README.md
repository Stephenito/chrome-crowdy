# Developer dashboard
This repository contains a web page where you can upload the .json file downloaded from the extension.
The page elaborates the data caught from the extension and summarizes them.

To use the page:
- go to "https://appquality.github.io/chrome-crowdy/";
- choose the .json file to upload.

Two pages are currently available:
- the initial page, containing a graph with the events on the timeline (excluding cookies and storage events). Here you can click on the columns of the graph to show the details about the events you selected;
- the tables page, containing information about cookies, storage and extension installed on the browser. Here you can click on the specific cookie/storage variable to show the data about it, or click on the domain to show all of them. Then, if you click on the specific event, all changes that have been made on that time will be shown in a popup.
